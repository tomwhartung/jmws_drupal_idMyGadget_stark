# jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8

Code to integrate idMyGadget [jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8) with the default Drupal 8 theme Stark.

Note that there is an experimental version of this repo named [jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8-exp](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8-exp).

Also note that this is the third time we are doing this (fourth if you count drupal 7!).

* First try was with Drupal 7; there was an incompatibility issue with jQuery Mobile and the version of jQuery that it was using

* Second try was with Drupal 8; it changed a lot and did not get very far

* Third try was also with Drupal 8; for some reason I was not able to place blocks in that version - I suspect it had something to do with the machine name - weird

This repo incorporates changes made to the previous repos as appropriate, but at this time we are creating it mainly to have its name consistent with jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8 , which magically does not have the mysterious and very serious issues (unable to add blocks, wtf?!?) we had with jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8.
