# jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8

Code to integrate idMyGadget [jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8) with the default Drupal 8 theme Stark.

Note that this is the third time we are doing this (fourth if you count drupal 7!).  The most recent version (jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget) is for some reason not able to have blocks placed in it.  Weird!
